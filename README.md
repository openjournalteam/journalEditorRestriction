This plugin will disable access for Journal Editors to the following sections:
- Journal Settings

- Workflow Settings
- Distribution Settings
- Users & Roles
- Tools
  
## About 
Based on our experience when handling our clients, some of our clients come from OJS 2.x and in OJS 2.x, the Journal Editors only have access to only some of the sections in the dashboard. But in OJS 3.x, the Journal Editors have same access as Journal Managers. This plugin is created to restrict the access of Journal Editors to the sections mentioned above.

## Installation
- Go to [releases](https://github.com/openjournalteam/journalEditorRestriction/releases) page.
- Download latest release tar.gz file.
- Upload the tar.gz file in your OJS 3 Plugin Manager

## Configuration
- Currently there's no configuration needed for this plugin. Once the plugin is enabled, the Journal Editors will not be able to access the sections mentioned above.
